The following visualization is incomplete. Currently it:
- Reads data from a database and draws a timeline based on the number of females
- Mousing over a female gives you her description (but it currently doesn't work well because I don't know how to do text wrap D: )

Female icon created by Mushu from the Noun Project: https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=female&creator=2482976&i=968330

Javascript libraries used:
- JQuery: For reading the database
- PapaParse: For parsing the database
- Snap.svg: SVG drawing and interaction
