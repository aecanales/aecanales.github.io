# Femicide in Chile - An interactive visualization 

[**Check it out!**](http://aecanales.github.io/) (in spanish)

A work created for the course *Visual Thinking* of the Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile. It's far from finished enough, but I leaving it as it.

**Libraries used**
* [*Snap.svg:*](http://snapsvg.io/) Main SVG drawing and interacion
* [*JQuery:*](https://jquery.com/) For loading the csv and some css manipulation
* [*PapaParse:*](http://papaparse.com/) For parsing the csv

**Known Issues**
* Many things are drawn at pixel positions, so they look bad on any screen that isn't mine
* Mistakes in the database, many females are incorrectly categorized
* The female icons load in slowly, which looks quite ugly

**Thanks to**
* Mushu from Noun Project for the [female icon](https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=female&creator=2482976&i=968330)
* [Fontfabric](http://www.fontfabric.com/) for the nice fonts
